    "\n",
    "CA consists of rules that determine the transition of cells in the grid plane from one state to another. There are a discrete number of states that are proportional to the number of cells that the cell is interacting with. When the rules are applied to a specified number of cells, the cells chage from one state to another, or remain in the same state.\n",

The state of the cells corresponds to the values of 1 or 0 in the context of the color value in black or white respectively. The next state of each cell is determined by states of its left neighbor, the right neighbor, and its own. It would be useful to examine Figure 1 to better understand the concept of state of cells."

    "The figure above consists of eight separate small shapes. Each small shape consists of three cells on top and one cell below them. For two-state cellular automata, there are eight different states that three cells can have. When three cells at the top are examined, eight different color sequences are seen. The single cell located under the three cells represents the next state of the cell in the middle of the three cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Figure 1, the following state of the middle cell can be obtained simply: If the state of one of the three cells is black, the next state of the middle cell becomes black. CA, consisting of three neighboring and two states, can, however, determine the next state according to 256 different way. It is impossible to make a definition for each state transition. There is a better way to do this. A rule number is given for each different state transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule number is determined by the state of the eight underlying cells in the Figure 1. In the cellular automata, the black  and the white cells correspond to the number 1 and 0 respectively. In the above figure, if we write the number equivalents of the individual cells below, we can get the value 11111110. The resulting numerical value is considered to be a binary number. This is because the cells are composed of two states. The number 11111110 is in the binary base is 254 in decimal base. This number is the rule number applied on cell. For example; In Figure 1, the next state of the cell in the middle is obtained according to Rule 254.\n",

    "Up to this point we talked about two-state cellular automata. The number of rules that cellular automata can have is 256. Since three cells can take up to eight different states, the rule value can consist of eight bits in the binary base. This means that different 2^8  rules can be applied. There is an exponential relationship between the number of rules that can be applied and the number of neighbors. If we formulate this relationship. The number of neighbors to k and the number of states n would be the number of rules  n^(n^k). 2(2^3)= 256. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the number of state increases to three, what will be the result? In this case, the number of rules will be 3^(3^3) = 7 625 597 484 987\". Having so much rule makes it impossible to practice. This can be reduced by taking the rules in certain conditions. Wolfram set a rule for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "0, 1 ve 2 represented by white, gray and black in three state cellular automata demonstration. The next state of the cell is obtained according to the totals of these three cells. Accordingly, the number of rules will be 2187. Let's get a little more of how we get the number of rules. A one-dimensional cellular automaton has three neighbors, including its own, left and right cells. If these cells have a k number of values, can have 3k-2 different rules for totalistic automata. For such a case number k^3k-2 different rule is obtained. If the number of colors is 3, then the number of rules we get is 3^ 3x3-2 = 2187\"."
